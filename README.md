# Airbnb Forecasting and Pricing

Forecast the demand/orders of Airbnb listings and find the best pricing strategy to maximize rental revenue.

## 1.  Background and Problem Formulation

For an Airbnb host, one of the challenges is to set the 'right' prices (nightly rates) to get the highest possible rental revenues. 
The Airbnb platform has introduced several pricing tools, e.g. base price suggestion and dynamic pricing, but gives little explanation on those suggestions.
And based on my experience, those suggested prices given by the platform not necessarily yield good rental revenues. So I turn to data science for a second opinion.

One way to tackle a pricing problem is to break it down into two sub-problems: 1) find the demand curve, i.e., how many nights would get booked at a given price for a given period; 2) find the best price to maximize the total revenue.
